# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures and best practices implemented in this Firebase template.

## ✅ Security Checklist

### Firebase Configuration
- [x] **Environment Variables**: All Firebase config values are stored in environment variables, never hardcoded
- [x] **Gitignore**: `.env` files are properly excluded from version control
- [x] **Security Rules**: Comprehensive Firestore and Storage security rules implemented
- [x] **User-based Access**: All data access is scoped to authenticated users only
- [x] **No Admin SDK**: Client-side code uses only client SDK methods

### Authentication Security
- [x] **Auth State Persistence**: Proper handling of auth state across page refreshes
- [x] **Email Verification**: Email verification checks in protected routes
- [x] **Listener Cleanup**: `onAuthStateChanged` listener properly cleaned up
- [x] **Component Unmounting**: State updates prevented on unmounted components
- [x] **Loading States**: All auth operations have proper loading states
- [x] **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all auth operations

### File Upload Security
- [x] **File Size Limits**: 10MB maximum file size enforced
- [x] **File Type Validation**: Only allowed file types can be uploaded
- [x] **Upload Error Handling**: Failed uploads are properly cleaned up
- [x] **User-specific Storage**: Files stored in user-specific folder structure
- [x] **Progress Tracking**: Upload progress and error states handled
- [x] **Input Restrictions**: HTML file input has accept attribute restrictions

### React Security
- [x] **Error Boundaries**: Error boundaries wrap Firebase operations
- [x] **UseEffect Cleanup**: All listeners and subscriptions properly cleaned up
- [x] **Async Operation Safety**: Component unmounting handled during async operations
- [x] **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated and sanitized
- [x] **Loading States**: All async operations have loading states

### Deployment Security
- [x] **Environment Variables**: Production environment variables properly configured
- [x] **Build Optimization**: Production builds are optimized
- [x] **SPA Routing**: Firebase hosting configured for client-side routing
- [x] **HTTPS Enforcement**: All connections use HTTPS
- [x] **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS headers configured

## 🔒 Security Rules

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
// Users can only access their own data
match /users/{userId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// Files are private to each user
match /files/{fileId} {
  allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId;
}
```

### Storage Rules
```javascript
// User-specific file access only
match /users/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// 10MB file size limit
match /{allPaths=**} {
  allow write: if request.resource.size < 10 * 1024 * 1024;
}
```

## 🛡️ Input Validation

### File Upload Validation
- **File Size**: Maximum 10MB per file
- **File Types**: Only specific file types allowed:
  - Images: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP
  - Documents: PDF, TXT, CSV, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPT, PPTX
- **Authentication**: User must be authenticated to upload
- **Sanitization**: File names and metadata are sanitized

### Form Validation
- **Email**: Proper email format validation
- **Password**: Minimum 6 characters, complexity requirements
- **Required Fields**: All required fields validated
- **XSS Prevention**: User inputs are properly escaped

## 🚨 Security Monitoring

### Error Logging
- Client-side errors logged to console (development)
- Failed authentication attempts tracked
- File upload failures monitored
- Network errors handled gracefully

### Access Control
- Authentication required for all protected routes
- Email verification can be enforced
- User sessions managed securely
- Automatic logout on token expiration

## 🔐 Data Protection

### Personal Data
- User profiles stored securely in Firestore
- Passwords hashed by Firebase Auth
- Email verification required for sensitive operations
- User data deletion supported

### File Security
- Files stored in user-specific directories
- No public file access without authentication
- File metadata protected
- Failed uploads cleaned up automatically

## 🌐 Network Security

### HTTPS
- All connections forced to HTTPS
- Secure cookie settings
- HSTS headers configured
- Mixed content prevented

### CORS
- Proper CORS headers configured
- Origin restrictions in place
- Preflight requests handled
- Credential inclusion controlled

## 🔄 Security Updates

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Automated dependency checks
- Package audit integration

### Firebase SDK
- Latest Firebase SDK versions
- Security patch monitoring
- Breaking change assessments
- Migration path planning

## ⚠️ Common Vulnerabilities Prevented

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
- User inputs properly sanitized
- Content Security Policy headers
- React's built-in XSS protection
- Dangerous HTML avoided

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
- Firebase Auth tokens prevent CSRF
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Origin header validation
- Proper authentication flows

### Injection Attacks
- Parameterized Firestore queries
- Input validation and sanitization
- Type checking on all inputs
- No direct SQL queries

### Information Disclosure
- Error messages don't leak sensitive data
- Debug information hidden in production
- Source maps excluded from production
- Environment variables protected

## 📋 Security Review Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] All environment variables configured
- [ ] Firebase security rules deployed
- [ ] HTTPS certificate active
- [ ] Error boundaries tested
- [ ] File upload limits enforced
- [ ] Authentication flows tested
- [ ] User permissions verified
- [ ] Input validation working
- [ ] Error logging configured
- [ ] Security headers configured

## 🆘 Incident Response

### Security Issues
1. Immediately revoke compromised credentials
2. Check Firebase security rules
3. Review access logs
4. Update affected dependencies
5. Notify users if necessary
6. Document lessons learned

### Data Breaches
1. Identify scope of breach
2. Secure the vulnerability
3. Assess data exposure
4. Comply with regulations
5. Communicate transparently
6. Implement additional safeguards
